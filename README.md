# Cincy SafeSpace

---

### **Team**  
Members: Kirran Magowan, Sam Welsh, Justin Frank  

Working Agreement: Will meet synchronously once a week on Saturday mornings from 9am~12pm and ad hoc during the week. Rest of work will be done asynchronously with communication over text.  

### **Introduction**  
Have you ever wanted to go to a local Cincinnati park or greenspace, but you weren’t sure how safe the area was? For a lot of University of Cincinnati students, these spaces are a great place to go for a run, throw the frisbee, or have lunch with a friend. But with no easy way of knowing how safe the area is, it’s not always a safe option. This app is intended to inform park-goers of the crime rate in the desired park’s/greenspace’s area. While we had students in mind when establishing the app, it can certainly be used by anyone interested in visiting these beautiful spaces.  

### **Functional Requirements**  
> <ins> **Requirement 1: Search for Parks/Greenspaces** </ins>  

Scenario: As a user, I want to be able to search parks/greenspaces across Cincinnati so that I can see different destination options.  

> <ins> **Requirement 2: View Park/Greenspace Details** </ins>  

Scenario: As a user, I want to be able to see the details of each park/greenspace (e.g. park type, crime rate) so that I can make a more informed decision on where I want to go.  

> <ins> **Requirement 3: View Crime Statistics** </ins>  

Scenario: As a user, I want to be able to view the deeper crime statistics (e.g. most common crimes reported, most common time of day for reported crimes) for each park/greenspace so I can better plan my trip and be more aware of what to watch for.
